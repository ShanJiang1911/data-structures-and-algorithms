# Trees
Create a Binary Tree class and a Binary Search Tree class, with pre_order, in_order and post_order method

## Challenge
* instantiate an empty tree
* instantiate a tree with a single root node
* add a left child and right child to a single root node
* return a collection from a preorder traversal
* return a collection from an inorder traversal
* return a collection from a postorder traversal

## Approach & Efficiency
BigO time: O(n)
BigO space: O(n)
