# Challenge Summary
Traverse an array, then return an new array with array elements in sorting sequence. New array will be incrementally sorted.

## Whiteboard Process
Please check [BLOG](python/sorts/insertion-sort/BLOG.md)

## Approach & Efficiency
It will iterate through every element in the array to compare the rest of the elements, and change element value accordingly. Time(O) will be O(n^2) and Space(O) is constant O(1)

## Solution
Please check [insertion-sort](python/sorts/insertion-sort/insertion_sort/insertion_sort.py)
