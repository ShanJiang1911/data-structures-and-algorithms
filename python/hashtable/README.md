# Hashtables
Implement hashtable.

## Challenge
Impletment hashtable class with add, get, contains, and hash methods

## Approach & Efficiency
Hash tables time complexity is O (1) in the best-case scenario. The worst-case time complexity is O(n) when mana values generate the same key
Space complexity for hashtable is O(n)

## API
<!-- Description of each method publicly available in each of your hashtable -->
